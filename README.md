# BacteriaImageProcess
This is for our project: to segment bacteria images and identify what bacteria species are in this image.

The cdbn-github is code for unsupervised feature learning using Convolutional RBM, and we use GMM/BMM to do initialization which can
shorten the training process. And after feature extraction, we exploit liblinear toolbox to do supervised classification.

This is the first part of our project, and we will publish another part after we are ready.
